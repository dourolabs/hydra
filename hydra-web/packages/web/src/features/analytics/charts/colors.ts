/**
 * Shared chart palette. Picked from the project's status / brand colors so
 * the analytics page reads in the same idiom as IssuesListPage badges:
 *  - `merged`  → green   (matches the merged/closed status tone)
 *  - `created` → neutral grey
 *  - `closed`  → soft red (terminal-but-not-shipped)
 *  - `accent`  → blue (single-series default)
 *
 * Token-usage series ordered so the stack reads input → output → cache
 * (read then write). Hues cool→warm so adjacent layers stay distinguishable
 * against the dark surface. `tokensInput` and `tokensOutput` deliberately
 * avoid the `accent`, `merged`, and `closed` hexes so the cost-per-agent
 * bar (which uses `accent`) and the four-series stack can coexist on the
 * same page without two series rendering as the same color.
